Learn some reactjs with the help of reactjs documents

## React Js

- React is a javascript library for building user interfaces.
- Design simple views for each state in your application, and react will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complete UIs.

### A simple component

- React components implement a render method that takes input data and return what to display. This example uses an XML like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.
